# phpIPAM Ansible Modules

This collection provides modules to manage entities in a [phpIPAM](https://phpipam.net/). This is neighter a collection of roles nor playbooks. It provides modules to wrote your own roles and/or playbooks.

We get a lot of inspiration from [foreman-ansible-modules](https://galaxy.ansible.com/theforeman/foreman) for our modules.

## Installation

The collection is available via [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/codeaffen/phpipam). So you can run

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install codeaffen.phpipam
```

Alternatively you can build and install the collection from source.

```bash
make dist
ansible-galaxy collection install codeaffen-phpipam-<version>.tar.gz
```

## Documentation

### readthedocs.io

Current documentation can be found on [readthedocs.io](https://phpipam-ansible-modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### ansible-doc

If you have installed the collection you can facilitate `ansible-doc` to display documentation for a given module.

```bash
$ ansible-doc codeaffen.phpipam.section
> SECTION    (/home/user/ansible_collections/codeaffen/phpipam/plugins/modules/section.py)
